        <h3>you made it! thanks for your patience in navigating through this book.</h3> <br>

        <h3>this reactive book is an interdisciplinary work</h3> 
        <h3>that consists of images, poetry and sound,</h3> 
        <h3>and is based on the artist's childhood memories of</h3>
        <h3>flipping through children's books -- </h3> 
        <h3>those books were never short of colorful drawings that,</h3> 
        <h3>every moment, would stir up the artist's imagination.</h3> 
        <h3>so here's an artist's book that can hopefully do the same to its readers.</h3> <br>

        <h3>all images and poetry are original works by the author,</h3> 
        <h3>but the the artist would like to make note that</h3> 
        <h3>all forms of art should be a fruit of inspiration</h3>
        <h3>and even appropriation from various sources.</h3> <br>
        <br>
        <h3>special thanks to my mom</h3>
        <h3>Haruko Murano</h3> 
        <h3>for her enduring love and prayers</h3> <br>

        <h3>a work by Aimee Kwon</h3> 
        <h3>multimedia artist</h3>
